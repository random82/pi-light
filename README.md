Led light prototype with RasperryPi and SenseHat

## Bill of materials

The lists the parts needed to build set it up.

### To get samples working

| Part | Quantity |  Notes |
|------|:----------:|-------|
| RaspberryPi | 1 | I used RaspberryPi Zero W but any version compatible with SenseHat will work |
| SenseHat | 1 | [Official SenseHat page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/) |
| Micro SD Card | 1 | Minimum 8GB. I wasted time with cheap cards, learned my lessons, and now recommend getting [a proper card](https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sd-card-raspberry-pi-3-b) |
| Micro USB Cable | 1 | If you power it from a USB port |
| Micro USB Power Supply | 1 | If you power it independently you can use [an official 2.5A Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/) |

### Optional

| Part | Quantity |  Notes |
|------|:----------:|-------|
| Case | 1 | With 40 GPIO cut-out, [the official case is great](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-case/), but I enjoy looking at the board and using [an acrylic case](https://core-electronics.com.au/slim-case-for-raspberry-pi-zero.html)  |
| Smartphone clamp with 1/4" socket | 1 | I'm using [Manfrotto PIXI](https://www.manfrotto.com/au-en/pixi-clamp-for-smartphone-with-multiple-attachments-mcpixi) but there are alternatives - just make sure they can clamp at around a case; For me it was ~6.5cm for the acrylic or ~7.5cm for the official one. |
| Desktop tripod with 1/4" screw | 1 | I'm using a tripod that comes with Logi C920 |
